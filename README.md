# Financial Modeling with Matlab : Portfolio Optimization and Simulation

This repository is a collection teaching material that I used to provide to undergrate students.
The material illustrate how to solve minimum variance portfolio with excel and matlab.
It is assumed that you have some basic knowledge on matrix algebra and modern portfolio theory.

I highly recommend "Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis" by Elton et al.
